FORGERY CHANGELOG

So, a few things have changed here!

Rather than send data to a PostgreSQL instance, I figured it would be better to have CSV files generated so you can use them how you want!

These CSV files are still in the categories of the old version (Tribes, Patreon, and Combined. No duplicates in any!)

Thereâ€™s also now a UI for fun!
